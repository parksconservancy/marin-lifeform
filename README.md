## Marin County Lifeform Leaflet Map
This is a simple web map created in leaflet that allows users see the publicly available services without needing GIS software or skills. It uses an Esri plugin for consuming vector tiles. 

The map displays a vector tile service hosted publicly on the Parks Conservancy ArcGIS Online organizational page. 

The Marin County lifeform map is a 26-class land use and land cover map of Marin County, reflecting the state of the landscape in summer, 2018.  This product is a simplification of the fine scale vegetation map, with a fraction of the total map classes.  The fine scale vegetation map has significantly more floristic detail than the lifeform map; woody vegetation communities in the 82-class fine scale map are mapped to the alliance level of the National Vegetation Classification.
